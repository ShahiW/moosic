## Brainstorming

### What we want to do:

* Analyse music datasets:
    * Genre
    * Artists/Bands
    * do we have a dataset to combine which artists are linked to a special mood?

<br>

* Make a Recommendation System Model:
    * similar songs/artists should be predicted
    * can we make a _mood filter_ ?

<br>

* Build a web app:
    * example [gnoosic](https://www.gnoosic.com/) (survey like)
    * example [everynoise](https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html) (word cloud)
    
    &rarr; can we combine? 

<br>

### What we need to do:

* __Check datasets__
* __Look for features__
* do we need __web scraping__ or is there a dataset: artists/bands __linked__ to __genres__?

<br>

On monday we will talk about our findings and use [miro](https://miro.com/) to brainstorm and bring our thoughts/process to "paper".
