##  __Sketch__

<br>

> __Overview__

* **Focus industry** : 
    - Entertainments, arts and media 
        - Music (on streaming services)
        - Podcasts

    - Tags
        - Music perception and trends, music cognition
        - Music therapy, depression, acoustics, semantics
        - Streaming services
        - Survey, profession
        - Emotions (emotional intensity), human learning, personality traits
        - Culture (cultural anthropology)
        - Psychology (behaviorial, priming and relaxation)
        - Mental health and psychiatry
        - Bioacoustics, entropy, memory, 

<br>


* **Who are your stakeholders?** : 
    - streaming related services
    - health services
    - users & music lovers

<br>

* **Posible ideas so far** :

    - analyze the top 100 billboard charts from these data sets
    - what music genre/artist/.. was most present / successful how has the music taste change over the years are there trends for the future? 
    - model to predict top 10 song-genres maybe? Or predict if a "new song" will become a top ten one?
    - analyse the behavioural effects of music and how it shows up in trends (top 100 songs or artist etc). `The behaviorial impact of music and how this affects trending music`.
    - the make a recommendation based on this (a dashboard or app or something where users can input their mood/current state and get a helpful recommendation)

    - other addons/options or posibilities (may or maynot be managaeble in timeframe but future work) : 
        - analyse the Songs by their melody (notes and chords) and get which were the most common and most successful ones
        - create a ML model to predict wich melody could most likely lead to a top ten hit
        - genre categorization of music/artist related content and prediction
        - frontend web development and dashborading

<br>

* **What do you want to build as a data product/solution?** : 
    - `Recommendation system for music/artist related content based on user preference.`
    - `End to end data pipeline (automated) to perform analysis of our data. `
    - `Dashboard/app to get user input and filter music  based on input.`
    - `Build ML algorithms to predict genres or next trends in music.`
    - `Method to curate a cohesive playlist(s) for listeners better than what spotify currently does (especially adventorous listeners with diverse & changing tastes :D).`
